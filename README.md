Here's the code for a project called The Giant's Door. (Unfortunately until I can recover the raspberry pi from wherever
it is, I probably won't be able to find the final version of the code.)

Submitted for the [2018 Red Bull Creation build competition](https://makezine.com/2018/07/03/red-bull-creation-returns-high-five-machine-9-crazy-contraptions/), this code was written in 72 hours along with the project that it was supposed to power: a large door exploring the concept of human love. The user would be invited to knock on the door. From behind the door, a voice known as the Giant prompted the user to submit a form of a time they experienced love. They'd receive a receipt that contained another submission.

Project consisted of:
* a large door which we outfitted with a knocker and a mailbox
* a raspberry pi
* an accelerometer to detect knocking
* a speaker
* a thermal printer
* a writing desk with printed forms and pens
* an infrared sensor to detect letters falling through the mailbox


Some sample submissions we received (we received these during a test run, and used them as candidates for what would be
printer on the receipts for future submissions):
